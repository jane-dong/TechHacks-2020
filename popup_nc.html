    <p>
      Andean civilization is a unique civilization that posed many environmental challenges. 
      They did not have a written language but instead used a series of knotted strings to convey 
      information known as a quipu. 
      Transportation was mostly done by foot and sometimes llamas. Agriculture was more challenging 
      in the region so more creative agricultural techniques were used due to uncertainty of plants 
      growing. For example farmers would grow their crops at different elevations and moisture levels. 
      It is now located in what is now known as Peru
