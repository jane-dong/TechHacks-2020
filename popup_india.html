    The Indian subcontinent was a fertile cradle of civilization, home to the Indus Valley Civilization that thrived between 2600 and 1900 BCE. This civilization developed advanced urban architecture, including baked brick houses and intricate water supply and sewage systems. However, much of their cultural beliefs and practices are lost to time, and modern scholars remain unable to decipher the Indus language.
<p>
By 1800 BCE, drought and climate change had dispersed the larger population centres of the Indus Valley people. Later, a group of nomadic tribes now known as the Indo-Aryan people made their homes in the valley and slowly turned to agriculture; their cultures mingled with the remnants of the Indus Valley culture, kindling the Vedic age of ancient India (ca. 1500 - 500 BCE). This age marked the establishment of highly stratified social classes that would remain influential for centuries more. Other developments that arose during the Vedic period include a religious antecedent to Hinduism, refined pottery arts, and advancements in trades and agriculture.
