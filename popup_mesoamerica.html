  Mesoamerica refers to a collection of ancient civilizations that shared similar cultural traits over a region spanning what is now modern day Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Such civilizations include Olmec, Maya, Zaptec and more. Mesoamerica civilizations shared diverse geographical terrain and spoken languages. They developed advanced cyclical calendars and are credited with pioneering the concept of zero. The Maya written language is the first written language to use signs and letters to communicate syllables which can be combined into words. Mesoamerican civilizations are known for practicing ritual bloodletting and human sacrifices.
